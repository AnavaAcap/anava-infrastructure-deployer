# ðŸŽ‰ SUCCESS - v0.9.165 Complete and Working!

## Mission Accomplished! 

### âœ… What We Did:
1. **Fixed macOS 15 Network Permission Issue**
   - Added comprehensive permission service
   - Integrated EHOSTUNREACH detection
   - Created automated fix + manual fallback

2. **Built & Released v0.9.165**
   - GitHub Actions build completed successfully
   - All platforms built (Windows .exe, macOS .dmg)
   - Properly signed and notarized

3. **Downloaded & Installed**
   - Downloaded Anava.Vision-0.9.165-arm64.dmg
   - Installed to /Applications/Anava Vision.app
   - App launches successfully

4. **Tested Network Access**
   - App is in firewall (permission working)
   - Direct TCP connections work
   - Helper script functional
   - No crashes, no GPU issues

## The Complete Solution:

### For macOS 15+ Users:
When camera discovery fails with network block:
1. **Automated Fix Dialog** appears first
   - User clicks "Fix Automatically" 
   - Enters admin password
   - Problem solved!

2. **Manual Fallback** if auto-fix fails:
   - Clear instructions provided
   - Terminal commands can be copied
   - System Settings shortcut available

### For Windows Users:
- **No changes needed** - works normally
- **No dialogs shown** - platform checks prevent macOS code from running

### For macOS 14 and Earlier:
- **No changes needed** - works normally
- **No permission required** - only macOS 15+ needs this

## Test Results:
```
âœ… App builds successfully
