## Authentication & API Key Generation
- Fixed: API key now generates immediately on home screen after Google login
- Fixed: Removed auth cache clearing race condition issue
- Fixed: Simplified ACAP deployment to only use HTTPS with Basic auth

## Camera Context Integration
- Fixed: CameraSetupPage now properly saves cameras to global CameraContext
- Fixed: CompletionPage dropdown now shows cameras from global context
- Fixed: Camera credentials properly persist across app navigation

## Performance Optimizations
- Optimized: Scene capture now triggers immediately after ACAP deployment
- Optimized: Scene analysis runs in parallel with speaker configuration
- Optimized: Detection Test page has pre-fetched scene data on arrival

## Critical Fix from v0.9.171
- Fixed: Removed obsolete conditionals that were skipping service account creation
- Fixed: All deployment steps now run regardless of AI mode"
