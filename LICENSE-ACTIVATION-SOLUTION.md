# License Activation Solution - SOLVED! ðŸŽ‰

## The Breakthrough

Thanks to your friend's insight, we discovered that Axis provides a **public JavaScript SDK** that can convert license keys to signed XML without any authentication!

## How It Works

1. **Axis SDK**: Located at `https://www.axis.com/app/acap/sdk.js`
2. **No Authentication Required**: The SDK is publicly accessible
3. **Simple API**: `ACAP.registerLicenseKey({ applicationId, deviceId, licenseCode })`
4. **Returns Signed XML**: Complete with cryptographic signature

## Implementation

The code now:
1. Uses Puppeteer to load the Axis SDK in a headless browser
2. Calls `ACAP.registerLicenseKey()` with the license details
3. Gets back the signed XML
4. Uploads it to the camera using the existing VAPIX endpoint

## Key Code Changes

```typescript
// Old approach (failed - needed API auth)
const response = await axios.post('https://gateway.api.axis.com/...');

// New approach (works!)
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: true });
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.setContent(htmlWithAxisSDK);
const result = await page.evaluate(() => window.ACAP.registerLicenseKey(...));
```

## Benefits

- âœ… **Fully Automatic**: No manual steps required
- âœ… **No API Keys Needed**: Uses public SDK
- âœ… **Works for Any License**: Dynamic conversion
- âœ… **Production Ready**: Integrated into main code

## Testing Results

```
âœ… SDK successfully converts license key to XML
âœ… XML upload to camera works
âœ… License shows as "Valid" with correct expiration date
âœ… No more "401 Missing Credentials" errors
```

## Version 0.9.105

This version includes:
- Full automatic license activation using Axis SDK
- Comprehensive error logging
- Retry logic for ThreadPool errors
- No manual intervention required

The mystery is solved - Axis Device Manager uses this same SDK approach!
