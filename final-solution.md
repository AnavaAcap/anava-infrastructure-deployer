# Final Analysis: License Activation Solution

## The Reality

After extensive investigation, here's what we know for certain:

1. **Manual activation works** - The XML upload method we discovered works perfectly
2. **Axis API requires authentication** - The `https://gateway.api.axis.com` endpoint requires credentials we don't have
3. **Axis Device Manager can do it** - But likely uses one of:
   - Embedded API credentials in the binary
   - User authentication flow (My Axis account)
   - Certificate-based authentication

## Current Working Solution

We have successfully implemented license activation using the signed XML format:
- The XML contains the device ID, expiration date, and cryptographic signature
- Upload works via multipart form data to `/axis-cgi/applications/license.cgi?action=uploadlicensekey`
- The license shows as "Valid" after upload

## The Missing Piece

The conversion from plain license key to signed XML requires:
- API access to `https://gateway.api.axis.com/info-ext/acap/aca/oldGw/v2/licensekey`
- This API requires authentication (returns 401 without proper credentials)

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Accept Current Limitation
- The code logs clear instructions for manual activation
- Configuration push works (with retry logic for ThreadPool errors)
- This is a one-time setup per camera

### Option 2: Reverse Engineer ADM
- Download Axis Device Manager
- Use tools like Wireshark to capture its network traffic
- Reverse engineer the binary to find API credentials
- Legal/ethical concerns with this approach

### Option 3: Official Support
- Contact Axis for developer API access
- Join the Axis Developer Program
- Get official API credentials for license conversion

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach
- Store pre-converted XML for known license keys
- Implement a simple license server that stores key->XML mappings
- Update the mappings as new licenses are activated manually

## Code Status

The current implementation:
- ✅ Correctly identifies when license activation is needed
- ✅ Attempts to call Axis API (fails due to auth)
- ✅ Falls back gracefully with clear instructions
- ✅ Pushes configuration successfully (with retry logic)
- ✅ Has comprehensive error logging

The "ThreadPool" error is now handled with retry logic and delays.
