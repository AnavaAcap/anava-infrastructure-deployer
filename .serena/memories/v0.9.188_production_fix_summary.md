# v0.9.188 Production Fix Summary - VERIFIED WORKING

## Critical Issue Resolved
**The 60% deployment failure affecting all production users has been fixed and verified.**

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Issue**: License activation failed silently at ~60% progress
- **Cause**: Activator files (`activator.html`, `axis-sdk.js`, `preload.js`) were not included in production builds
- **Why it worked for developer**: Source files present in `src/main/activator/`
- **Why it failed for users**: Production builds missing `dist/main/activator/` directory

## Solution Implemented
1. Created `scripts/copy-activator.js` to copy activator files during build
2. Modified `package.json` build:main script to run copy after TypeScript compilation
3. Added comprehensive error display for all license failures
4. Shows full JSON responses for debugging

## Key Files Changed
- `package.json`: Added copy-activator.js to build:main script
- `scripts/copy-activator.js`: New file to copy activator assets
- `src/renderer/pages/camera/ACAPDeploymentPage.tsx`: Enhanced error display

## Testing & Verification
- Build process confirmed copying files correctly
- Windows installation tested and working perfectly (2025-01-15)
- Mac build also includes the fix (universal binary)

## Lessons Learned
- TypeScript compiler only handles .ts files, not static assets
- Always verify production builds include all required files
- Full error display is critical for debugging production issues

## GitHub Actions Optimization
- Changed test workflow to only run on PRs and release tags (not every commit)
- This significantly reduces unnecessary CI/CD costs
