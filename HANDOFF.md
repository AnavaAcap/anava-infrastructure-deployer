# Anava Vision Magical Installer - Handoff Document

## Current State (v0.9.64)

The magical installer is now working with the following features implemented:

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Pre-emptive Camera Discovery**
   - Starts scanning immediately when app launches
   - Tries service discovery (mDNS/SSDP) first for fastest results
   - Prioritizes common camera IPs (.100-.200, .156, .88, .64)
   - Stops scanning the instant it finds an Axis camera
   - Camera at 192.168.50.156 is consistently found quickly

2. **Auto-Connect Magic**
   - UI polls for discovered cameras every 500ms
   - THE INSTANT a camera is found, it automatically:
     - Hides the manual entry form
     - Shows "Connecting to camera..." message
     - Starts the connection process immediately
   - No user interaction required if a camera exists on the network

3. **Google Authentication + AI Studio**
   - Google OAuth login works
   - AI Studio API key is automatically generated/retrieved
   - API key is passed to the magical discovery page

### ‚ùå Current Issue
**ACAP Deployment Failing**
- Camera discovery: ‚úì Working
- Camera configuration: ‚úì Working  
- ACAP deployment: ‚úó Failing with empty error

The logs show:
```
[2025-08-04T16:21:16.497Z] [INFO] Checking if BatonAnalytic ACAP is installed...
[2025-08-04T16:21:16.497Z] [ERROR] Failed to deploy ACAP: {}
[2025-08-04T16:21:16.497Z] [ERROR] Manual connection failed: {}
```

### üîß Next Steps to Fix

1. **Fix Error Logging**
   - In `fastStartService.ts` around line 950-960, the error is being thrown but not properly logged
   - Need to add proper error serialization: `logger.error('Failed to deploy ACAP:', error.message || error)`

2. **Debug ACAP Deployment**
   - The ACAP deployment service might be failing during:
     - Checking installed ACAPs
     - Downloading from GitHub
     - Uploading to camera
   - Need to add more detailed logging in `deployACAPQuickly()` method

3. **Possible Root Causes**
   - GitHub API rate limiting
   - ACAP download failing
   - Camera rejecting the ACAP upload
   - Service instantiation issues

### üìÅ Key Files
- `/src/renderer/pages/MagicalDiscoveryPage.tsx` - UI that auto-connects when camera found
- `/src/main/services/camera/optimizedCameraDiscoveryService.ts` - Pre-discovery logic
- `/src/main/services/fastStartService.ts` - Connection and ACAP deployment
- `/src/main/services/camera/acapDeploymentService.ts` - ACAP upload logic
- `/src/main/services/camera/acapDownloaderService.ts` - GitHub release downloads

### üöÄ Testing Instructions
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Click "Experience Magic"
3. Login with Google
4. Watch console - should see:
   - Pre-discovery finding camera at .156
   - Auto-connect starting
   - ACAP deployment attempt (currently failing)

### üí° Architecture Notes
- Pre-discovery runs in main process on app startup
- UI polls for results via IPC
- ACAP files are downloaded from `https://github.com/AnavaAcap/acap-releases`
- Uses VAPIX digest auth for all camera communication
- BatonAnalytic ACAP provides the AI scene analysis

The magical experience is 90% complete - just needs the ACAP deployment fixed!
