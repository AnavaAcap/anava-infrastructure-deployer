# White Screen Fix Summary - v0.9.178

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **DevTools Auto-Open in Production** ✅
- Modified `src/main/index.ts` to automatically open DevTools in production builds
- Added console logging for the exact file path being loaded
- This allows you to see any JavaScript errors in the Console tab

### 2. **Script Tag Placement** ✅  
- Created a custom Vite plugin `moveScriptToBody()` that ensures the script tag is placed in the body AFTER the `<div id="root">` element
- This prevents the "Cannot find element with id 'root'" error that causes white screens

### 3. **Firebase Module Resolution** ✅
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to properly resolve Firebase submodules
- Added explicit imports for firebase/app, firebase/auth, firebase/firestore, firebase/storage
- Added alias for Firebase to resolve package correctly

### 4. **Base Path Configuration** ✅
- Confirmed `base: './'` is set in Vite config for file:// protocol compatibility
- This ensures assets load correctly when using Electron's loadFile() method

### 5. **License Activation Fix** ✅
- Fixed the license activation to use the camera's actual MAC address instead of hardcoded fallback
- The MAC is now passed from camera discovery through to the activation function

## How to Test

### Quick Test (Already Built)
```bash
npx electron dist/main/index.js
```
DevTools will open automatically. Check the Console tab for errors.

### Full Build & Test
```bash
./BUILD_AND_TEST.sh
```
This script will:
1. Clean and rebuild everything
2. Test with Electron directly (with DevTools)
3. Build a signed DMG for distribution

### Manual Build Commands
```bash
# Build only
npm run build

## Debugging Checklist

If you still see a white screen, check these in DevTools:

### Console Tab
- [ ] Look for "Failed to load resource" errors
- [ ] Check for "Uncaught ReferenceError" 
- [ ] Look for Content Security Policy violations
- [ ] Check for "Cannot find module" errors

### Network Tab  
- [ ] Enable "Disable cache"
- [ ] Reload the window
- [ ] Check if `index-*.js` loads successfully (200 OK)
- [ ] Check if all assets in `/assets/` folder load

### Elements Tab
- [ ] Verify `<div id="root"></div>` exists
- [ ] Check if React components are rendered inside #root
- [ ] Verify script tag is in body, not head

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **404 errors on assets**
   - Issue: Path resolution problem
   - Fix: Already fixed with `base: './'` in Vite config

2. **CSP violations**
   - Issue: Content Security Policy blocking scripts
   - Fix: CSP is already configured for Firebase and Google APIs

3. **React not mounting**
   - Issue: Script executing before DOM ready
   - Fix: Already fixed by moving script to body

4. **Firebase errors**
   - Issue: Module resolution failures
   - Fix: Already fixed with proper imports in Vite config

## Files Modified

1. `src/main/index.ts` - Added DevTools auto-open and path logging
2. `vite.config.ts` - Added moveScriptToBody plugin and Firebase fixes
3. `src/renderer/pages/camera/ACAPDeploymentPage.tsx` - Fixed license activation
4. `src/main/services/camera/cameraConfigurationService.ts` - Accept MAC address
5. `src/main/preload.ts` - Pass MAC address parameter

## Test Results

When running the test script, the app successfully:
- ✅ Built without errors
- ✅ Launched Electron 
- ✅ Opened DevTools automatically
- ✅ Loaded index.html from correct path
- ✅ Script tag is now in body after root div

## Next Steps

Run `./BUILD_AND_TEST.sh` when you wake up. The DevTools will show you exactly what's happening. If there are still issues, the Console will reveal them.
